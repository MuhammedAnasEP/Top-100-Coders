### About Me

I studied B-Tech in computer science, but I failed it. After my four years of college life, I joined Brototype, which is a self-learning platform. The industrial expert assigns the task and reviews the week-based task. From there, I learned a lot about the industry. And I worked on two projects. Now I am looking for good companies to showcase my skills.
